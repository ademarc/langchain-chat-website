If you're using a Unix-like operating system (like Linux or macOS), you can usually install `libmagic` using your system's package manager. For example, on a Debian-based Linux system (like Ubuntu), you can install `libmagic` using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmagic1
```

On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install libmagic
```

If you're using a Python environment, you might also need to install the `python-magic` package, which is a Python interface to the `libmagic` file type identification library. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install python-magic
```

After installing `libmagic`, try running your application again and see if the error persists.
